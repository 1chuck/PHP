# PHP
PHP experiment, because I don't have a method to run my code.
  I messed up completely trying to use the "Xampp" package.  Now, I have messed up previously useful icons on my desktop.  It would be good to be able to test things out on the internet, without doing in your own 'puter.
  I now have a file server @ Open Shift (Red Hat).  They allow one month free access.  I've set up the file server to process .php and mysql.  Now, I want to write some brief code, send it over to Open Shift and access it in a new window to see how my meticulous and/or rediculous .php coding went.
